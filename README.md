# Tute

NOTE THAT THIS BRANCH IS DEPRECATED (maintained to remember my own key exchange implementation hehe

A simple Tute game using basic Python asyncio and vanilla stuff. Has a nice feature of semi-security. Packets are encrypted, but I wrote it in house. Obviously you'd use SSL in a professional environment, but I wanted to get a bit of a better understanding about how this all worked. Note that we also reuse the same keypair. BAD.

# Tute
A simple Tute game using basic Python asyncio and vanilla stuff. Has a nice feature of semi-security. Packets are encrypted, but I wrote it in house. Obviously you'd use SSL in a professional environment, but I wanted to get a bit of a better understanding about how this all worked. Note that we also reuse the same keypair. BAD.

NOTE THIS BRANCH IS DEBRECATED!

This is probably one of the worst designed projects I have ever embarked on. At least now I know what not to do and I understand a bit more about networking.
